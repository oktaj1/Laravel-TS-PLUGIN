TsPlugin
A simple Laravel package to run TypeScript scripts via a button in the application.


nstallation
1. Require the package via Composer
You can add the package to your Laravel project by running:

bash

composer require ff/tsplugin


2. Publish the Assets (Optional)
If the package includes any assets (like JavaScript or CSS), you can publish them to your Laravel application's public directory:

bash

php artisan vendor:publish --tag=public --force
This will copy the assets to public/vendor/tsplugin.


3. Service Provider
The TsPluginServiceProvider will be automatically discovered by Laravel, so you don't need to manually add it to the config/app.php providers array.

Usage
Once installed, you can start using the package in your Laravel application.

Add a Button to Trigger TypeScript Scripts

In any Blade view, you can add a button to trigger the TypeScript script:

html

<button id="run-ts-script" class="btn btn-primary">Run TypeScript Script</button>

Link the Button to TypeScript Script

Add a JavaScript function to handle the button click event and execute the TypeScript script:

js

document.getElementById("run-ts-script").addEventListener("click", function() {
    // Logic to trigger the TypeScript script (you might need to use a route or controller to run it)
});


You will need to define the backend logic for running the TypeScript script via a controller or command. This is where your TypeScript files will be executed.


Configuration (Optional)
If you need to customize the behavior or paths for the TypeScript files, you can update the relevant settings in the package or create a configuration file:

bash

php artisan vendor:publish --tag=tsplugin-config
This will copy the configuration file to config/tsplugin.php.


Testing
To test the package in your own Laravel project:

Follow the installation steps above.
Add the button and script trigger as described in the Usage section.
Ensure that the TypeScript scripts are working as expected.
